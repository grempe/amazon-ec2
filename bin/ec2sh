# Usage : running this starts up an irb session and
# sets up the connection to EC2 as a class variable called
# '@ec2'.  So just do something like the following on the
# shell command line:

#   macbook-pro:~ glenn$ ec2sh
#   >> @ec2.describe_images
#   => [#<EC2::Item image_location...

ec2_lib   = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../lib/EC2'
setup = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/setup'
irb_name = RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mswin32/ ? 'irb.bat' : 'irb'

if ( ENV['AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] && ENV['AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] )

  welcome_message = <<-MESSAGE

  'ec2sh' usage :
  This is an interactive 'irb' command shell that allows you to use all
  commands available to the amazon-ec2 gem.  You'll find this to be a
  great tool to help you debug issues and practice running commands
  against the live EC2 servers prior to putting them in your code.

  The EC2 connection is wired to the class instance '@ec2'.  Make method calls
  on this to execute commands on EC2.  Adding a #to_s
  at the end of any command should give you a full String representation of the
  response.

    Examples to try:

      returns : all ec2 public methods
      >> @ec2.methods.sort

      returns : a string representation of ALL images
      >> @ec2.describe_images.to_s

      returns : an Array of EC2::Response objects, each an EC2 image and its data
      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item
      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item[0] (an OpenStruct of a single item in that array)
      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item[0].to_s (a String representation of that OpenStruct item)
