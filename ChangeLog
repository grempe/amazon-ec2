=== 0.2.0 2007-07-03

 * MAJOR library changes : THESE CHANGES ARE NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE!!  You will need to update
 the way in which you make calls, handle responses, and rescue exceptions from this library.
 If you prefer not to make these changes you can feel free to continue to use the older version
 of the gem.  These older versions however will no longer be maintained.

 * MAJOR refactoring of how methods calls are made.  Now all methods are called with a simple hash
 of arguments and none of them are positional.  This feels much more "Ruby'ish".

 * MAJOR refactoring of how responses are returned to users.  No longer do you have to call the
 .parse method, and no longer are you getting back simple arrays of information.  Responses
 now come in the form of OpenStruct objects that contain all of the data for an object in
 Enumerable form so you can use iterators (.each, .each_pair, etc).  All methods return an AWS::Response object
 which inherits from OpenStruct.  The return data from EC2, which is in XML form, is parsed
 with XmlSimple and is used to directly construct the return data structure.  This allows us
 to know with some confidence that the data structure returned from AWS will always be consistent
 with this library's responses.  There is also an .xml attribute for each response object that lets you
 see the full and complete XML response from AWS if that is useful to you.

 * Added an exception framework which will now throw appropriate Ruby exceptions
 that match those handed to us by Amazon EC2.  ArgumentError exceptions will also
 be thrown if you are making calls we know to be illegal or malformed.  You should rescue
 these exceptions in your application instead of parsing text responses.  All exceptions
 descend from AWS::Error.  You can see them all in exceptions.rb in the gem install.

 * Added a full suite of test/spec unit tests which currently cover 100% of the public methods
 in this library.  We have abot 92% code coverage according to rcov.  This has greatly enhanced
 the reliability of the library as well as our confidence in the code.
 We used to have 0% test coverage. :-/

 * Added an EC2 command shell : 'ec2sh' which can be called from anywhere and gives you
 an interactive irb session with an EC2 connection pre-made for you as @ec2.  You can use this
 to interactively execute any command on EC2 that this library supports.  Try @ec2.methods.sort
 or @ec2.describe_images to test it out.  You must first setup two shell environment variables
 which contain your ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY for this to work.  Otherwise an error
 will be thrown when you try to start it.  This is way cool and shamelessly borrowed from
 Marcel Molina's fine AWS::S3 library.

 * Updated API version in the query API request to 2007-01-19, and added all known method calls
 in this version of the API to the gem (including reboot, viewing console output, NAT addressing
 and more!)

 * Removed .parse method as it is no longer needed or wanted.

 * Removed 'verbose' attribute writer and a couple of related debug 'puts' calls in EC2.rb.

 * Removed deprecated alias's used in the library that were added in v0.0.3

 * Gem now requires XmlSimple gem to be installed.


=== 0.1.0 2007-05-30

 * Repackaged with updated newgem generator v. 0.10.3 from http://newgem.rubyforge.org/ to take advantage of new deployment goodness.


=== 0.0.7 2007-03-15

 * Applied patch from Kevin Clark which does the following:
   * New method to the instances.rb to allow for issuing a reboot command to an EC2 instance.
   * New Mocha based tests (Mocha test suite must be installed to run tests.  'sudo gem install mocha')
   * Cleanup of the test directory.
 * Applied patch from Randy Bias related to CGI escaping error.  From his notes:

 I finally figured out what was going on.  It was a compound problem.  The first being that you can't
 CGI::encode the UserData early.    You have to just Base64 encode it.  Unfortunately, when you Base64
 encode it, it means that some encodings will be padded with extra chars, specifically the '=', but &, ?
 and = get stripped by EC2.canonial_string.  So if a Base64 encoding has trailing ='s for padding,
 these get stripped and then you sign the UserData Base64 payload sans the padding.  But it looks
 like Amazon's side is doing the right thing and is signing the padding.  So, the signatures mis-match.

 I've got the complete patch here and it's about as elegant/clean as I could make it in a short
 period of time.  It's a little tough to strip those equal signs when there are so many in the URI.
 I think this works pretty well, though.  I'm splitting the URI on '&', then for each field ripping
 out all '&' and '?' and only the first '='.  Then stitching it back together.


=== 0.0.6 2007-03-02
 * Patched instances.rb with a bugfix and patch provided by Randy Bias (Thanks Randy!).
 Only minimally tested so please let me know if this causes any problems for anyone.

 From his notes:
 I wanted to let you know that there appears to be a bug in how user data is passed.  In
 instances.rb the line that creates the base64 encoded package of user data is as follows:

 userData = CGI::escape(Base64.encode64(in_params[:userData]).strip())

 This may have worked prior, but at least right now the CGI::escape appears to cause a
 breakage.  More specifically it turns something like this (the actual base64 encoded string):

 YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh
 eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHgg

 Into this:

 YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh%
 0AeHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHgg

 And it looks like EC2 chokes on the %0, which is CGI::escape's way for handling an EOL.
 Unfortunately, the Base64.encode64 (at least in my 1.8.5 version of Ruby) inserts a
 EOL at every 47 chars, no matter what:

 ---
 [randyb@master randyb] cat /tmp/foo.rb
 #!/usr/bin/env ruby
 #
 require 'rubygems'
 require_gem 'amazon-ec2'
 require 'getoptlong'
 puts Base64.encode64
 ("012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789")

 [randyb@master randyb] /tmp/foo.rb
 MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0
 NTY3ODkwMTIzNDU2Nzg5
 ---

 The best way to handle this is to strip the CRLFs/EOLs before passing to CGI.escape.


=== 0.0.5 2006-12-21

 * Changes to home page documentation and example files to indicate that you
   should use 'require_gem' instead of a simple require.  Not sure if this
   is a result of something I am doing in the packaging of the gem that is
   incorrect or if this is right and proper.  I will investigate further.
 * Patched instances.rb run_instances method to allow for submission of
   user data with the command to start an instance.  Patch submitted
   anonymously on RubyForge.  This had not been functionally implemented
   in the Amazon Web Services sample library prior to this patch.
 * Added simple framework for adding unit tests for the library under test dir.
   No functional unit tests exist yet.


=== 0.0.4 2006-12-21

 * Applied patch from Kevin Clark to svn version 7.  Thanks for the
   patch and the description Kevin!  Please report if you
   encounter any issues with this patched version.  Here is Kevin's
   description which I requested :  "It helps me to think of modules as boxes full of classes and
   methods.  REXML is a module which holds various classes related to parsing XML
   including REXML::Node, REXML::Document and REXML::XPath. When you
   include a module it takes everything out of the box and places it in
   the local context.  So, when you include REXML in the global namespace
   on line 27 of EC2.rb, it includes classes called Node, Document and XPath in the
   global object space. This means that I can't have a class called Node
   in my own project (which I do). The library would be a much better
   neighbor if it instead accessed the REXML::Document and REXML::XPath
   classes explicitly through the module."


=== 0.0.3 2006-12-16

 * API CHANGE : Changed method name 'authorize' to 'authorize_security_group_ingress' to ensure consistent
   naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'authorize' for backwards compatibility.
 * API CHANGE : Changed method name 'revoke' to 'revoke_security_group_ingress' to ensure consistent
  naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'revoke' for backwards compatibility.
 * API CHANGE : Changed method name 'delete_securitygroup' to 'delete_security_group' to ensure consistent
  naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'delete_securitygroup' for backwards compatibility.
 * API CHANGE : Changed method name 'describe_securitygroups' to 'describe_security_group' to ensure consistent
  naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'describe_securitygroups' for backwards compatibility.
 * API CHANGE : Changed method name 'create_securitygroup' to 'create_security_group' to ensure consistent
  naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'create_securitygroup' for backwards compatibility.
 * Added many API rdoc's, some method descriptions copied from Amazon Query API Developer Guide.
 * Extracted some parts of the formerly monolithic EC2 library out into separate files for manageability.
 * Changed the HTTP 'User-Agent' string used for each request so that we have our own user agent
   to identify this library's calls.  Now set the version # in the user agent string based on the
   master version number for this library which is stored in lib/EC2/version.rb and should only
   be defined in one place.
 * Set @http.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE to avoid seeing SSL Cert warning
   "warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session". File EC2.rb:96
 * Make 'pathlist' utility method a private method (EC2.rb:111).  No reason I can see for this to be exposed.


=== 0.0.2 2006-12-14
