# CREDITS : Credit for this bit of shameful ripoff coolness

# Usage : running this starts up an irb session and 
# sets up the connection to EC2 as a class variable called
# '@ec2'.  So just do something like the following on the 
# shell command line:

#   macbook-pro:~ glenn$ ec2sh 
#   >> @ec2.describe_images
#   => [#<EC2::Item image_location...

ec2_lib   = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../lib/EC2'
setup = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/setup'
irb_name = RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mswin32/ ? 'irb.bat' : 'irb'

if ( ENV['AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] && ENV['AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] )
  
  welcome_message = <<-MESSAGE
  
  'ec2sh' usage :
  This is an interactive 'irb' command shell that allows you to use all 
  commands available to the amazon-ec2 gem.  You'll find this to be a
  great tool to help you debug issues and practice running commands
  against the live EC2 servers prior to putting them in your code.
  
  The EC2 connection is wired to the class instance '@ec2'.  Make method calls 
  on this to execute commands on EC2.  Adding a #to_s 
  at the end of any command should give you a full String representation of the
  response.  The #xml data is available for each response
  which allows you to view the full and complete XML response returned by
  EC2 without any parsing applied.  This is useful for viewing the 
  hierarchy of an entire response in a friendly way (if XML is friendly
  to you!).  Understanding the hierarchy of the XML response is critical
  to making effective use of this library.
    
    Examples to try:
      
      returns : all ec2 public methods
      >> @ec2.methods.sort
      
      returns : a string representation of ALL images
      >> @ec2.describe_images.to_s
      
      returns : an Array of EC2::Response objects, each an EC2 image and its data
      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item
      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item[0] (an OpenStruct of a single item in that array)
      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item[0].to_s (a String representation of that OpenStruct item)
      
      returns : an XML representation of all images
      >> puts @ec2.describe_images.xml
      
      returns : an XML representation of all images owned by Amazon
      >> puts @ec2.describe_images(:owner_id => 'amazon').xml
