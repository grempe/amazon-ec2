# Usage : running this starts up an irb session and 
# sets up the connection to EC2 as a class variable called
# '@ec2'.  So just do something like the following on the 
# shell command line:

#   macbook-pro:~ glenn$ ec2sh 
#   >> @ec2.describe_images
#   => [#<EC2::Item image_location...

ec2_lib   = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../lib/EC2'
setup = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/setup'
irb_name = RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mswin32/ ? 'irb.bat' : 'irb'

if ( ENV['AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] && ENV['AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] )
  puts "Usage : This is an interactive 'irb' command shell that allows you to use all commands available to the amazon-ec2 gem.  The EC2 connection is wired to the class instance '@ec2'.  Make method calls on this class instance to execute commands on EC2.  e.g. >> @ec2.methods.sort or >> @ec2.describe_images"
